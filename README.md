# Metaball

Draws several circles to canvas that can be moved by mouse. Attempts to determine the clustering of the circles (groups of circles that intersect). Draws the circles within a cluster to be the same color.

**Status**: Work-In-Progress (only determines the first cluster)

**TODO**: reduces circles into "unclustered" group and repeat the clustering for those remaining.

### Steps

1. Run `npm start`
1. Move mouse in canvas to control overlap/clustering of circles
