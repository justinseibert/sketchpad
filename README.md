# SCSSTSPAD
A canvas "sketchpad" with Sass and Typescript.

This repository contains several distinct branches which have spawned from this main branch.
Each branch demonstrates a different page of the sketchpad, most a constant work-in-progress.

### Current Branches

1. `cluster`: circle-based cluster detection
1. `metaball`: circle-circle intersection, curve merging
1. `pathway`: random-walks, tree branches, weighted decisions
1. `kaleidoscope`: hashed identicons, 8-bit pixel arrays, rotation, reflection, translation
1. `skywriter`: random-walks, boundary detection, loop de loops, ligatures
